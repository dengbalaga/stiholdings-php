            <p><img src="assets/img/article/profile_image.jpg" width="322" height="187" align="right" style="margin-left:24px; margin-bottom:6px;"> STI Holdings (&ldquo;the Company&rdquo;) is the holding company within the Tanco Group that drives investment in its education business.  It is a publicly-listed company in the Philippine Stock Exchange and its registered address and principal place of business is 7th Floor iAcademy Building, 6764 Ayala Avenue, Makati City.</p>
            <p>STI Holdings, being a holding company, derives its revenues from dividends declared by its subsidiaries and interest income on short-term placements.</p>
            <p>STI Education Services Group, Inc. (&ldquo;STI ESG&rdquo;), a Subsidiary of STI Holdings, and its subsidiaries, as educational institutions, derive its revenues from tuition and other school fees from its owned schools and royalties and other fees for various educational services provided to franchised schools. STI ESG has a total of 80 schools nationwide and is comprised of 64 STI branded colleges and 16 STI branded education centers.  Of these, 27 college campuses are wholly-owned, while 37 college campuses are operated by franchisees, 12 educational centers are operated by franchisees, and 4 are wholly-owned educational centers. STI ESG purchased STI Batangas from its franchisee in September 2013.</p>
            <p>Apart from the STI branded campuses, iACADEMY has one campus in the Central Business District of Makati while DLS STI College has a campus adjacent to De Los Santos STI Medical Center.</p>
            <p>STI ESG&rsquo;s college campuses offer associate/ baccalaureate degree and technical/vocational programs in ICT, arts and sciences, business and management, education, engineering, hospitality and tourism management, and healthcare. These programs are accredited by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and/or Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). The education centers of STI offer technical/vocational diploma, certificate, and short-term courses for computer programming, computer technology, software applications, and office administration, among others. The programs in the education centers are also accredited by TESDA.</p>
            <p>STI Holdings is a party to a joint venture agreement and a shareholders&rsquo; agreement by and among the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (&ldquo;PWU&rdquo;), UNLAD Resources Development Corporation (&ldquo;UNLAD&rdquo;) and Attenborough Holdings Corporation.  UNLAD is a real estate company controlled by the Benitez Family, whose assets are used to support the educational mission of PWU. Under the agreements, the parties engaged in a series of transactions which resulted in the Company making loans to PWU and UNLAD that shall be repaid by the conversion of the loans into a 40.0% interest in the total issued and outstanding capital stock of UNLAD. As a result, the Group nominates its representatives as members and trustees of PWU, the board of directors of UNLAD and certain key officers of PWU and UNLAD.  STI Holdings has submitted all the required documents to effect the conversion of this loan to equity.</p>
            <p>PWU is a private non-stock, non-profit educational institution which provides basic, secondary and tertiary education while UNLAD is a real estate company controlled by the Benitez Family and has some assets which are used to support PWU&rsquo;s educational thrust.</p>
            <p>On October 1, 2013, STI Holdings acquired a controlling stake in West Negros University Corp. (WNU) through the purchase of 99.45% of its issued and outstanding common stock and 99.93% of the issued and outstanding preferred stock.</p>
            <p>The acquisition is part of the planned expansion of the Company.  It also widened its course offerings at the tertiary level.  It provided STI Holdings another entry into basic education which is the focus of the government&rsquo;s K-12 program, and into the graduate school level which is vital in updating the development of human capital in the country.</p>
            <p>At the time of acquisition, WNU has 5,075 students in all three levels, that is, basic education, tertiary and graduate school.  The University&rsquo;s 3.1 hectare campus is situated in the center of Bacolod City in Negros Occidental.</p>
